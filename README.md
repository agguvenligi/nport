nport
=====

NPort is an attempt to handle critical port views of big networks. If you are legally responsible for the security of big IP v4 blocks, this is for you. By determining critical ports that your organization possesess, you can easily maintain your global view by;

    importing large xml nmap results,
    live & automatic whois queries,
    excluding IP ranges you don't own or don't cover, 
    on the fly excluding whois ranges, 
    open port trend snapshots, 
    listing & processing nmap xml outputs locally, 
    granularly rescan existing results,
    search existing results given ip ranges,
    blazing fast initial web analysis by web page slider,
    automatic credential brute forcing of the open ports of a given ip address,
    and not the least graphically present results to your eager-to-see-pictures management. :)
